<p>Open Graph for Joomla 4 and 5 in Menu and Article. The plugin allows you to set OG tags for defined menu items and articles.</p>

<p>What you need to know:</p>

<p>The system plugin in Joomla allows you to set og meta tags in order to properly share content on social networking sites using Open Graph, e.g. Faceboot or X (Twitter). Basic information about OG tags is stored in the plugin's configuration. They may be overwritten by settings in Articles or ultimately in Menu. This means that in the hierarchy, the menu item's OG tag settings have the highest priority over the OG tag settings in the article. The plugin overwrites any OG meta tag generated by any component.</p>
